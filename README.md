Title for the project : Effects of light flash properties on pupillary light reflex

• One paragraph abstract : The size of the pupil changes to accommodate the amount of ambient light, but this change is dependent on a variety of factors including attention, arousal, saccadic activity, and other variables.  Mainly, the pupillary light reflex (PLR) is a conserved ocular mechanism across species to balance the conflict between environmental light level and the desire for high visual acuity.  In this project, we will investigate how light sources in peripheral vision change the PLR.
• Brief description of the project (methods, expected results etc.): We propose to use eye-tracking of pupil size to measure PLR to different light stimuli.  We will vary stimuli by eccentricity (as well as different locations in y), size of stimulus, and with different wavelengths.
Hypotheses: 
Wavelength/color of light will have no effect on pupillary response, (once total power of transmitted luminance at the retina is taken into account).  (We may modify this as we learn more about RGC cells sensitivity to melanopsin.)

Size  
Ambiguity in defining “size” … are we stepping down luminance or will it also scale w/ stimuli size.
Eccentricity/location
Foveal flashes will elicit more pupil constriction than peripheral flashes.
• Rough allocation of duties for team members : Currently, we are all working on designing the project.  Carter is going to take the lead in designing the stimuli for the project.  We have agreed to use Github and Python to share our analyses and code for the project, and will continue to assign duties as the project progresses.
